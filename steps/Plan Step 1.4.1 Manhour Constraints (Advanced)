# Implementation Plan Step 1.4.1: Manhour Constraints (Advanced)

- **Task**: Implement Constraint C9/C10 (Manhours). This is complex. **Attempt 1 (Simpler):** Assume fixed manhour consumption per shift during maintenance. Use `AddCumulative` on depot resources, where capacity is `AvailableManhours_ds` and demand is fixed per active maintenance task at that depot. **Attempt 2 (Harder):** Model variable duration based on manhours (requires relating interval size to resource consumption, potentially needing decomposition or complex callbacks, may be beyond initial scope). Start with Attempt 1.
- **Files**:
    - `rail_optimizer/core/optimizer.py`: Add `AddCumulative` constraints for depot manhour resources.
- **Step Dependencies**: Step 1.3.5
- **User Instructions**: Run `python run_core_test.py`. Check solver status. This step has a high chance of causing infeasibility or requiring model adjustments.
