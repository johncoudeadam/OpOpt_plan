# Implementation Plan Step 1.3.3: Maintenance Location Constraints

- **Task**: Implement C8 (Maintenance Location). Enforce that if maintenance is performed (`maint_performed`), the location at the start of the maintenance shift (`loc_start_vs[(v_i, start_s)]`) must be the `maint_assigned_depot[inst_i]`. Also, enforce location continuity during maintenance: `loc_start_vs[(v_i, s+1)] == loc_start_vs[(v_i, s)]` if `maint_active_s[(inst_i, s)]` is true. Implement C11 (Routing to Depot): Ensure `loc_start_vs[(v_i, start_s)]` (location *before* maintenance starts) matches the required depot.
- **Files**:
    - `rail_optimizer/core/optimizer.py`: Add constraints linking `loc_start_vs`, `maint_performed`, `maint_start_s`, `maint_active_s`, and `maint_assigned_depot`.
- **Step Dependencies**: Step 1.3.2
- **User Instructions**: Run `python run_core_test.py`. Check solver status. This is a complex interaction point.
